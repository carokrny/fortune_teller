## General information
This is a JavaScript project to generate a fortune with multiple randomized sub-strings, so each fortune is (pretty) unique. In total, there are 6,804 unique fortunes.  

The randomized sub-substrings are assocaited with topics to avoid nonsensical fortunes. Topics include, for example, good relationships, bad relationships, change, etc.

Fortunes created have a first sentence and a second sentence. Both sentences include a phrase based in a randomly selected topic, a first phrase and second phrase, respectively. First phrases are each associated with 1 topic. Second phrases can be associated with multiple topics. 

The fortunes are displayed on a webpage, using CSS and HTML. 

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* VS Code version 1.58.1
* Git version 2.30.1
* Node version 14.17.1 for testing JavaScript

## Inspiration 
This project is based on Codecademy's Mixed Messages Project. Codecademy provided the broad prompt of a random message genorator. All code written from scratch, and HTML and CSS are extensions of the original JavaScript console project.
